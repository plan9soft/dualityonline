# The White Horn of Everhold #

The Beasts and Humans had an Alliance, which soon turned into a Friendship. Much was trusted between Humans and Beast, for they traded their knowledge, items, and many other things of great worth between each other.

The King of the Beasts, decided, as an act of Trust, to create a Treasure unlike no other, and it took 20,000 days and nights to create. It was named the White Horn of the Everhold.
Created using one of the King's own horns, imbued with Dust from the Stones of Heaven itself, strong White Granite from the King's own Evercaves, and layered in feathers from the wings of fallen angels, the King shaped it himself perfectly, with absolutely no flaws.
It was the only item in existence to have no flaws.

Only after it was embedded with the power of an Ancient Magic, that prevented no other besides the King of the Beasts and the Leader of the Humans to take. It also had a few other spells that kept it clean, that it would protect the holder from Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and that which has been created by either Beast or Human. But because of its great value and worth, the Beast King got jealous.

The Beast King got jealous that he gave it to the Humans instead of keeping it himself.
So, to trick the Humans into keeping it where he could keep a safe eye on it, he built a Dome where nothing but that Treasure is stored.
